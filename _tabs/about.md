Hi, I'm TIny_Hacker, and I've been programming calculators since 2014! I'm an active member of [Cemetech](https://cemetech.net), and I enjoy making fun games as well as helpful programs. In my (other) spare time, I play the violin, mess around with stuff I barely understand, and sleep. You can find my profile on Cemetech [here](https://www.cemetech.net/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=30499) or check out some of [my projects](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/117/11706.html) on TiCalc.
